    <br>
    <p>I am a computer science student currently working in healthcare in a leadership role.
      I work full time and switch in between being a full-time or part-time student.<br><br>
    I'm currently taking the initiative to seek for an internship related to my major as well as
  working to enrich my skills by working on personal projects as well as contributing to open sourced projects.<br>
  My work experiences have taken me from the customer service sector to healthcare, I started working as an EMT in Seattle<br>
  for about 4 years, I was promoted to lead which brought about responsibilites that included our patients as well as our newer EMTs. <br>
  My time as a lead has helped me cultivate some valuable skills that are beneficial and fluid in the corporate or private sector. <br>
